Have worked in startup and built apps from ground-up for middle-tier, client, server and microservices using ONC/SUN RPC.
Extensively worked in C++.
Led teams to produce high quality software.
Good communicator.
 

Note: From the submission process I couldn't find whehter just the source files are need or the entire prject is needed to just open and compile. I am not sure.I am adding all the file for submission (Since I saw gitignore with some files, I am thinking git will ignore those files and commit the rest). Sorry, if this is any inconvenience.

All the projects (step1 & step3) are compiled with Visual Studio 2022 with C++ version 20.

The source code are placed at
   {ninjarmm_screening}/step1/src/step1.cpp
   {ninjarmm_screening}/step2/src/CodeReview.cpp
   {ninjarmm_screening}/step3/src/CodeChallenge.cpp

If anything is missing related to submission please let me or Barry know. 

Thank you for reviewing.
