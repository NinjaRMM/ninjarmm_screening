Step 1 and 3 were compiled using g++ -std=c++0x and executed with no errors.

Step 2: I assume the code is logically sound. Other than the missing includes, I feel the issues are mostly with variable declarations.
Variables should be declared with purpose specific to its usage. Names should be descriptive of its use, within its intended scope and close to its first use/assignment.
