Notes
================
i) I have created a SRC folder under each stepN folder.

step1/src/    contains 2 python scripts
step2/src     contains 1 c++ file step2.cpp with the implementation
step3/src     contains 1 c++ file step3.cpp with my reviewed code
step4/src     contains 1 c++ file step4.cpp with the implementation of the upgrade

ii) I have not changed the original files except for step1 which has been answered in line

iii ) I used C++14 for everything except for step4 which I used C++17 because I had to use variadic templates and passing a reference to a variable passed in this way and assigining a value to it is easier with c++17. If I do not get to the next steps, I ask you a favor if possible: let me know how it has been solved in C++11 or C++14.

iv) At step1, I was required to get some system info using a known programming language. I have used python 3.10. COuld not check at a MAC.
