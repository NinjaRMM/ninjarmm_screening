8. Why would you use new rather than malloc when allocating an object? Likewise, what’s the difference between free and delete?

a. It's better to use new over malloc, because new is an operator whereas malloc is a library function.
New allocates memory and calls constructor for object initialization. But malloc allocates memory and does not call constructor.
Return type of new is exact data type while malloc returns void*.
And also, new is faster than malloc because an operator is always faster than a function.


b. The difference between delete and free, is that delete is an operator that de-allocates the memory dynamically while the free is a function that destroys the memory at the runtime.
The delete operator is used to delete the pointer, which is either allocated using new operator or a NULL pointer, whereas the free function is used to delete the pointer that is either allocated using malloc, calloc or realloc function or NULL pointer.
When the delete operator destroys the allocated memory, then it calls the destructor of the class in C++, whereas the free function does not call the destructor; it only frees the memory from the heap.
And also, the delete operator is faster than the free function.
