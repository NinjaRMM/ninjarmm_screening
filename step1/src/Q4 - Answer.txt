4. Explain the keyword: static. What does it mean in each context?

Static is a keyword in C++ used to give special characteristics to an element. 
Static elements are allocated storage only once in a program lifetime in static storage area. 
And they have a scope till the program lifetime. Static Keyword can be used with following:

a. Static variable in functions are initialized only once, and then they hold there value even through function calls.
These static variables are stored on static storage area , not in stack.

b Static Class Objects are allocated storage in static storage area, and have scope till the end of program.
Static objects are also initialized using constructors like other normal objects. 
Assignment to zero, on using static keyword is only for primitive datatypes, not for user defined datatypes.

c. Static member Variable in class are those members which are shared by all the objects. 
Static data member has a single piece of storage, and is not available as separate copy with each object, like other non-static data members.
Static member variables (data members) are not initialied using constructor, because these are not dependent on object initialization.
Also, it must be initialized explicitly, always outside the class. If not initialized, Linker will give error.

d .Static Member Functions work for the class as whole rather than for a particular object of a class.
It can be called using an object and the direct member access . operator. 
But, its more typical to call a static member function by itself, using class name and scope resolution :: operator.
