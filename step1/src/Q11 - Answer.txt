11. What are the some of the principles of object-oriented programming?

There are 4 major principles that make an language Object Oriented. 
These are Encapsulation, Data Abstraction Inheritance and Polymorphism . 

a. Encapsulation is the mechanism of hiding of data implementation by restricting access to public methods. 
Instance variables are kept private and accessor methods are made public to achieve this.

b. Abstract means a concept or an Idea which is not associated with any particular instance. Using abstract class/Interface we express the intent of the class rather than the actual implementation. 
In a way, one class should not know the inner details of another in order to use it, just knowing the interfaces should be good enough.

c. Inheritances expresses “is-a” and/or “has-a” relationship between two objects. 
Using Inheritance, In derived classes we can reuse the code of existing super classes. 

d. Polymorphism means one name many forms. It is further of two types — static and dynamic. Static polymorphism is achieved using method overloading and dynamic polymorphism using method overriding. 
It is closely related to inheritance. 
We can write a code that works on the superclass, and it will work with any subclass type as well.
