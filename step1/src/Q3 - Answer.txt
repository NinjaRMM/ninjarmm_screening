3. What is the purpose of virtual destructors? What types of issues can arise if not used correctly. 

Virtual destructors in C++ are used to avoid memory leaks especially when your class contains unmanaged code, i.e., contains pointers or object handles to files, databases or other external objects.
One thing with have to be carefull is to avoid deletion of an instance through a base class pointer.
To avoid that, we can make the base class estructor protected and nonvirtual; by doing so, the compiler won't let us call delete on a base class pointer.
