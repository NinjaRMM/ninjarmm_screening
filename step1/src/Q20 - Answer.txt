20. Scenario: You are dealing with legacy code containing no test suites nor documented requirements, and are required to make a change. Describe your expected process for how you may approach the solution. 
	a. Consider both a long term and short-term solutions.
	
A short-term solution would be to use automated tests to make sure the code still behaves as it should after refactoring the code.
The purpose of the tests is to have a benchmark of the code's business rules. After that, it's possible to refactor the code in small parts.

A long term solutions would be to rewrite, document and test the code.
