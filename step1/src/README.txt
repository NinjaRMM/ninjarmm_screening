## Code Building

CMake and a C++20 compatible toolchain is required to compile the code.

To build it, run:
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make

I implemented two executables: step1 and test_step1.
The `step1` has the implementation of Requirements points from `e` to `i`.
the `test_step` run unit tests.
