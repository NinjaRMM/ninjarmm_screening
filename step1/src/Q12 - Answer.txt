12. Explain inheritance vs composition vs aggregation?

a. Inheritance refers to using properties and methods of an already exiting class in a new class. 
We call this already existing class the parent class, superclass or base class. 
The new class is called the child class, sub class or derived class.

b. Composition is a special type of aggregation that implies ownership. 
An object depends on another object and there is a dependency. 
Let’s look at a school object and a classroom object. 
The classroom object cannot exist without the school object. 
If the school object is destroyed, the classroom object is also destroyed.

c. Aggregation is an association that describes the “has a” relationship between objects. 
There is no dependency between the two objects. For instance, assume a classroom and student. 
Student object can exist without the classroom object. So, this is an aggregation. 
In other words, if the part can exist outside the whole, we call this an aggregation.
