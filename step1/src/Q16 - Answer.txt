16. What concept(s) in C++ would you use to manage resources automatically?
	a. How important are these concepts? 	
	b. What tools are you familiar with for tracking resource allocations? 
	
One concept to manage resources automatically is by using resources handles and RAII (resource acquisition is initialization).
The ideia is simple. We create a sort of proxy object for our resource.
The constructor of the proxy will acquire the resource and the destructor will release the resource. The key idea of RAII is that the C++ runtime is the owner of the local object and therefore of the resource.
Two typical examples of RAII in modern C++ are smart pointers and locks. Smart pointer takes care of their memory and locks take care of their mutexes.

a. These concepts are very important because they prevent memory leaks in the code, avoiding the program to crash during execution.

b. The Visual Studio profiler is a tool I used a lot to track memory leaks in a project I developed.
