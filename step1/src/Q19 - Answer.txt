19. Name some tools and/or techniques that you personally find to be the most helpful surrounding code maintenance.

The most helpful tool for code maintenance is Git. Git allow us to track the code changes and to easily identify bugs from different versions in the software.
For code maintenance I think that to write a readable code is very important. Not always a compact code means it is better to read and understand.
Sometimes writing more lines makes the code cleaner and easier to read, and consequently, easier to maintain.
Using variables names, classes and methods that describe the behavior of that code is easier to understand the functionality of the program.
One of the most important things I think are helpful while coding is writing good comments, especially when it's a complex code.
The comments will avoid other developers to take too much time to understand the code and to maintain it.
