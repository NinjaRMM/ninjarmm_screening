Dear Rita, Thank you for sending me this coding challenge.  I found it enjoyable and represented a real-world example.  

See attached submittedzip.zip file.   It contains:
assignment.txt - a copy of your email describing the assignment
eahomework1.cpp - my c++ source code 
output.txt - the output file created by my source code
readme.txt - describes my approach to this assignment, and what additional features I would implement if given the additional time.

Thanks again for allowing me to show you some of my work.  I look forward to hearing from you.

Hardware/Software used:
IDE:					Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2019, Version 16.10.0
System Manufacturer:	Dell Inc., Model XPS 13 9310 2-in-1
System Type:			x64-based PC
Processor:				11th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-1165G7 @ 2.80GHz, 2803 Mhz, 4 Core(s), 
						8 Logical Processor(s)
BIOS Version/Date:		Dell Inc. 2.3.3, 5/31/2021

My Approach:
1. Read the assignment a number of times to get an understanding of the requirements.
2. Sketched out an overview of the entire program flow
3. Sketched out the components of the details.
4. Implemented/tested the single-threaded version of the solution.
5. Implemented/tested the multi-threaded version of the solution.
6. Wrote this readme.txt file.
7. Created a zip file containing all the requirements.
8. Emailed to you :)

What I would do if I had additional time:
At my old job, I developed a similar process to this coding assignment.  That code was written on a
Solaris/Unix box, in Perl, C-Shell, etc.  I also wrote the documentation for that process and
disseminated it to our development group.

If I had more time to work on this assignment, I would:
- I would check if there was something abnormal with the thread
- Show a progress indicator, runtime status, jobs completed, queue status onto stdout, etc. 
- Check for a limit on the number of active threads prior to pushing a new task onto queue.
