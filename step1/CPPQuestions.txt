1. Explain the different types of containers available in the standard library, what are their differences? Explain use cases for each.
2. What are some sorting algorithms, list at least 3? What are their differences and give use cases for each.
3. What is the purpose of virtual destructors? What types of issues can arise if not used correctly. 
4. Explain the keyword: static. What does it mean in each context?
5. When are static member variables initialized? 
6. What is the difference between R-Values and L-Values?
7. Is this code safe? If so why? If not why?
	std::string foo()
	{
		std::string something = “avalue”;
		return something;
	}
	
	Bonus: What would most compilers do with this code?
8. Why would you use new rather than malloc when allocating an object? Likewise, what’s the difference between free and delete?
9. Explain the purpose of std::move, and std::forward.
