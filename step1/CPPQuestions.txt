1. Explain the different types of containers available in the standard library, what are their differences? Explain use cases for each.

    The two most used and important types are sequences and associative containers. Sequences are designed for elements that have some kind of 
	sequential order, like a list, and are used in most situations to represent plain of groups of data. The most important sequential container 
	is std::vector, which is a contiguous array of data that can grow dynamically (its static version would be std::array). Due to the locality
	of data, its the prefered type of container for many situations, even over std::forward_list (single linked list) and std::list (double linked
	list), as even if you are using only the extremes, the fact that data is contiguous and will land in cache is much more important than the 
	additional allocs. Howver, the list have a smaller memory footprint which could be useful in certain cases. There's also std::deque which is 
	an indexed queue, which, by not being contiguous still suffers the same disadvantages as the lists against vector.

	The associative containers are normally ordered, but they also have unordered versions, which in practice is usually more useful. This type of
	containers has data that can be searched fast usually by some kind of hash (tree in the case of ordered). The most important is std::map/unordered_map, 
	which stores key-value pairs and is useful for most situations that involve a search. For example, if you have a list of vms with information like
	OS, version, etc, in a class called VirtualMachineMetadata, and you want to access quickly one by its hostname, you can use a 
	map<hostname, VirtualMachineMetadata> so you can go from one to the other. std::set/unordered_set only stores each element once, and is useful if you
	want to avoid repeated elements or check if they already exist. In the rare case you want multiple times the same key, both have a multi-
	version, but they are much less useful.

	Finally, there are container adaptors, which are stacks and queues, providing a LIFO and a FIFO interface. They only provide an interface, and 
	intenally can use a sequence container (by default, deque).

2. What are some sorting algorithms, list at least 3? What are their differences and give use cases for each.

    Bubblesort: The most intuitive sorting algorithm, but very inefficient. Iterate through the list, and compare each element. If they are not in 
	order, swap them. Repeat until done. It's O(n^2). The only use case would be when you are 99% sure the list is already sorted or only a few elements
	are out of place (but are close the position would be), as in that case it's O(n).

	Insertionsort: Another very intuitive and simple to implement algorithm. It iterates through the list and puts each element in its place on it. It's
	useful in the case of very small datasets where building more datastructures would have more overhead than the straightsorting.

	Mergesort: A relatively simple algorithm but very efficient and stable, as it's O(nlogn). Divide the lists by two recursively until they are by one,
	and keep merging them in order. Intuitive and easy enough to implement, the good side is that it's very good to run on paralell. AsSign each thread/core
	or even vms each half and they can subdivide further if they have the resources. 

	Timsort: The combination of mergesort and insertionsort, created for python, but also used in Rust's sort. The idea is that it detects contiguous
	sorted subarrays and merges them like a mergesort. Since those subarrays are abitrary length and not a fixed size like mergesort, it can avoid many
	comparisons. It works well on "natural" data and is used in many languages.

	Quicksort: The default in many languages, including C++. Like Mergesort it's O(nlogn), but it's not stable, its worst case, which is when the list
	already has some type of sorting (which type depends on the implementation of the pivot), its O(n^2). It works by selecting a pivot and move it until
	it has a sorted list on one side (if doing smallest to largest, we choose the rightmost element as pivot and we move it to the left, leaving smaller
	elements to the left of the pivot, and an unsorted list to the right). Then repeat with the unordered list. It's usually more cache efficient than
	mergesort. Efficient versions usually have some kind of logic to the election of the pivot instead of choosing extremes.

3. What is the purpose of virtual destructors? What types of issues can arise if not used correctly. 

	Virtual destructors are necesary so maintain the hierarchy in destructors, so when you delete a derive class through its base class point, the
	destructor called is the derived, not the base. Not using them could cause leaks and all kind of unintended code being executed. An example would
	be a DerivedClass from BaseClass, which on its constructor reserves some memory, and its destructor frees it. If we do:

	BaseClass* b = new DerivedClass();
	delete b;

	The destructor ~BaseClass will be called, instead of ~DerivedClass, so all that memory will be leaking. Since a big part of C++ is RAII and 
	constructors/destructors get used for things like locks or even I/O, it's usually the case that you should use them when you want your class
	to be inherited, even if you aren't going to use base class pointers at first. It will bite later if you don't.

4. Explain the keyword: static. What does it mean in each context?

	- static variable or function in a file/namespace: Limits the scope of that element to that obj file. Useful when you dont want those functions 
	to be used outside of that "module" (internal linkage).
	- static member function in a class: This functions is not limited to any instance of a class, and can be used without it. Useful for general behavior
	that doesn't require specific data.
	- static variable in a class: Same but for a variable. A very common use is a counter for generating ids.
	- static variable in a function: The variable will persist between calls. Can be rather dangerous but can be used for small caches.

5. When are static member variables initialized?

	Initialization for static member variable is only allowed for const like a integer literal so there are no dynamic dependencies and cannot violate
	the ODR. Standard doesn't guarantee when they are initialized, only that its in order of their definition and in before any usage in any compilation 
	unit (which usually means they are statically initialized at the point or their definition), before main().

6. What is the difference between R-Values and L-Values?

	L-values are expressions that point to specific memory (identity), and rvalues don't point anywhere. In a more technical definition, l-value have
	identity and cannot be moved (they have to be copied), and r-values do not have identity and can be moved.

7. Is this code safe? If so why? If not why?
	std::string foo()
	{
		std::string something = "avalue";
		return something;
	}
	
	Bonus: What would most compilers do with this code?

	Yes, C++ as a language guarantees return value optimization, therefore it will be always safe and won't alloc any temporal object to be copied 
	in the caller (unlike when you pass a value to a function which will be copied). 
	When a compiler sees this function used, it will (most likely) generate the string directly on the parent and avoid the call at all. Tested on
	godbolt.org with clang14. The function itself is generated in any case just in case there's a external dependency for abi reasons, but can be 
	skipped with an inline.

8. Why would you use new rather than malloc when allocating an object? Likewise, what's the difference between free and delete?

	"new" will call the constructor, therefore in addition to reserve enough memory for the object, it will also initialize and 
	run specific code. "delete" will do the same but with its constructor.
	Generally for any object you should always use new over malloc.

9. Explain the purpose of std::move, and std::forward. 

	std::move when you want to call a function which instead of copying the values, it will take ownership of them.
	std::forward when a function with move semantics wants to keep using them to a called function. It's easier to see with an example.

	f(const T& a) { print("L-VALUE"); }
	f(T&& a) { print("R-VALUE"); }
	void parent(T&& a)
	{
		f(a); // will print L-VALUE
		f(std::forward(a)); // will print R-VALUE
	}

10. How do you share resources safely between threads? How would you share an integer value vs user defined type? 

	It varies a lot by case as there are many different situations. For simple things like an integer, using atomics 
	is the easiest way to get _safe_ values between threads, but keep in mind that memory safe and actually working and
	safe are different things. The use of locks is probably needed for many operations.
	For more complex objects, wrapping up with std::lock_guard and a mutex will be the traditional way to go. Whatever that
	wrapper is only for that object or it has more will depend heavily on the architecture.
