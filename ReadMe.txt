Thank you for letting me take on this challenge! I tried to do everything that was requested, as it was requested, and maybe I could have coded a little more on certain parts, but I felt like I was already over-bloating the cpp file. I've also added some piece of code, which is similar to what I've coded on my own project, which revolves around providing an easy-to-use interface for tasks in general, using variadic template arguments, so I hope that's ok with you. Another thing I did was to tweak the code in step2, even though I didn't have to, because I wanted to run it and change a few things. That way, I could show a little more of the changes I would have done.

Thanks!
