1. Write a small program in C++ that will contain the following:
	a. Create a class Job
	b. Create a subclass Programmer
	c. Create a subclass Pilot
	d. The job class should provide an interface that can do the following
		i. Get the name of the job
		ii. Get the description of the job. 
		iii. Get the number of hours required by the job
		iv. A DoWork function that prints out “My work involves ” + the description.  
	e. Dynamically allocate each type of job.
	f. Store each instance in a collection.
	g. Iterate the collection and call each of the available interface functions.
	h. Create a template function that will test if the provided values are within a range. Call the function and print out the inputs and result. The following should execute assuming httpResonse is a uint32_t value:
		i. IsInBounds<uint32_t>(httpResonseCode, 500, 599)
	i. Create a function that will take a vector of strings and a test function, It should return how many items in the collection matched the test. Then print out the result.
		i. auto theStrings = vector<std::string> { “one”, “two”,  “test”};
		ii. auto count = ContainsTheString([](const std::string& tested) { return tested == “test” }, theStrings);
	j. Write any other code you feel would show off your understanding of C/C++ and programming in general. Bonus: Variadic Template /w usage. 
	k. All The source can be in 1 file, it should compile and there should be no runtime errors, and no memory leaks. Use built in types freely to help you manage resources.
