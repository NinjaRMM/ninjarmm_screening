The following issues should be addressed:
1.	The variable versionNumber is not used and can be deleted.
2.	The pointer PtrProductList should be released before each return of the function.
3.	The pointer PtrProduct is only released when PtrProduct->get_ProductName fails or when everything is ok. This should be changed so that it is released after use.
4.	The pointer PtrVal should be freed with the call to SysFreeString after use or in case of error.
I have the following recommendations:
1.	The field Version of the struct ThirdPartyAVSoftware is not used in this context. Since there is also an unused variable called versionNumber, I am assuming that they could relate to a non-final implementation. Therefore, it should be checked if the struct field is used in the rest of the project code, and if not, it could be deleted.
2.	In order to minimise the issues that were mentioned above, a solution would be to use smart pointers for the variables PtrProductList and PtrProduct. This could be done by using the ComPtr class.
3.	In the for loop, I would prefer to change the type of i to LONG, ULONG, or auto. Although it can be considered correct as it is, since LONG is a signed 32-bit integer, there is the remote possibility of that changing at some point in the future.
4.	It may be interesting to see the value of hr when it is different from S_OK. This could help us diagnose any errors that could occur. Additionally, I prefer to have error messages reported through a function. The use of a function gives the flexibility to have error logging enabled or change the output iostream. Furthermore, I recommend using cerr instead of cout and adding std::endl at the end of each error.
5.	Unless otherwise specified in the Coding Standard, for performance and safety reasons, I prefer to postpone variable declaration until use. Similarly, I prefer to initialise them with a value instead of a default and then assigning a value.
6.	I would replace the if block with thirdPartyAVSoftwareMap.size() == 0 with !thirdPartyAVSoftwareMap.empty().
