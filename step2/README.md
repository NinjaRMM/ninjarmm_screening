# Intro
This folder contains the solution for Step2.
The present solution were builded using Visual Studio 2022, so it is expected to run on a .NET runtime environment.

# Code
The present solution was divided into two files: one containing the code review, and the other containing an example 
of a workaround. In summary, five main points drew attention during the code review: 1) Code snippets that can generate 
errors; 2) Very large methods; 3) Repetition of some actions; 4) The code does not work properly; 5) lack of writing 
standardization. The proposal for improvement was made thinking about correcting these points and bringing more comments 
about their behavior.
