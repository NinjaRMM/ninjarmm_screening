# Welcome!
Thank you for considering NinjaRMM as your future home. In this repository you'll find some of our screening materials that we expect you to complete. The folder structure is explained below. 

Take your time when completing these test materials as accuracy is important. Feel free to use whatever reference materials you need in order to complete and answer all of the questions. Incomplete submissions will not be considered. You should begin by creating a branch that contains your name and start date as you'll need to submit this as a pull-request once you are done. 

# Overview
The repository is broken down into the 4 individual steps we would like for you to complete. Each subfolder step1 -> step4 contains an individual piece of test material. We expect that the solution for each step will be contained as a subfolder, for example for step2 we ask you to write some basic C++ code for us. Ideally you would structure that folder so that the source code is contained in a subfolder called "src" so {root}/step2/src/* would contain your answer. 

You are free to use whatever compiler/platform you are most comfortable with. You may also use an online C++ compiler such as http://cpp.sh/ if you wish, if you do so please be sure to make a note of it as a comment in your code. 

### Step 1 
The first step is to answer all of the questions in CPPQuestions.docx, feel free to write you answers within that document itself. Use any reference materials that you need.

### Step 2
Take a look at Requirements.docx. The document will contain an explanation of the code that we are expecting to see. It involved writing some basic classes and demonstrating your understanding of class hierarchies, virtual methods, templates, standard containers, and resource managment. 

### Step 3 
In this step we ask you to review some code that came directly from the code you'll be working with if you join the team. Look over it carefully and provide feedback as you would in a standard code review. 

### Step 4
This contains the last and final coding challenge. We expect that you will modify the code in CodeChallenge.cpp to meet the requirements outlined in the comments contained within that file. 

# Submission
Once you feel you have everything in a good spot, please submit your answer as a pull-request against this repository and notify your contact that you are complete. We'll review it as soon as possible and get back to you.

Please make sure all of the following are checked:
1. All of the questions in step 1 have been answered. 
2. The code for steps 2 and 4 compiles and runs without errors. 
3. There should be meaningful feedback provided for the sample code in step 3.

Happy coding!
